        <h1>Social Media</h1><time>February 17, 2021</time></header><p>Social media has seen better days. Between the links to depression, the spread of disinformation, increased polarization, and growing concerns on data privacy, the problems with social media seem particularly in the spotlight these days. The Social Dilemma, a recent Netflix documentary highlighting several of these issues has reached 100 million people in 190 countries.</p>
<p>The problems with social media have become a mainstream topic. Increased social media use has been linked to a myriad of mental health issues. The past election cycles have put a spotlight on the problem of spreading disinformation and growing polarization amplified by social media platforms. The Cambridge Analytica scandal has surfaced major issues around user privacy and data.The Social Dilemma, a netflix documentary raising awareness of the dangers of social media, has reached 100 million people in 190 countries.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>How would I design the ideal social media for me?
There has been positive response to address the social media problem. The Social Dilemma outlined several steps consumers can take to fight back against the algorithm and break out of the attention economy, including turning off notifications, deleting apps from your phone, and not clicking on recommended videos. The Center for Human Technology has a guide for technologists with values to keep in mind when developing new tools including redefining metrics from engagement to well-being. However, these all take a very high level, macro view of the issue.</li>
</ol>
<p>Imagining a concrete and exciting future for social media is an important step towards building that future. However, taking into account all the problems, and needs of every user makes it very difficult to do anything other than produce general guidelines. What if instead we started back at the basics, by building something that users want, starting with the user I know best - myself.. How would I design the ideal social media for me, knowing what I know today?</p>
<p>The bad
On a personal level, my relationship with social networks (mostly Facebook) has been a difficult one. It became less of a tool that added meaningful social interactions online, and more my go-to hit of cheap dopamine when I wanted to avoid work, stress, or getting out of bed. I would find myself scrolling through the newsfeed mindlessly, and coming out of it in a daze of distraction and brain fog. To counter these unhealthy habits, I’ve deleted the app from my phone and deactivated my Facebook account on several occasions.</p>
<p>I recognize not everyone will relate to my experience, as it is shaped a lot by my own personality. However, I have heard several anecdotes of friends with growing dissatisfaction with Facebook for similar reasons, or simply because it doesn’t provide a lot of value for the time they spend. Some will disengage completely, deleting their accounts. Others find creative ways to modify it to make it more valuable, unfollowing everyone except for a handful of close friends to clean up their newsfeed. There are even browser extensions specifically designed for hiding news feeds.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Least favorite aspects of social media, times feeling most drained, unhappy</li>
</ol>
<p>My worst experiences almost always involve spending much more time than I intended to on a platform. Sometimes this is after making a post, and then habitually checking for new notifications and breaking up all time for concentration for hours. Other times it’s the “refridgerator effect,” when any tinge of stress or discomfort in real life prompts me to open the app searching for a brief relief of dopamine. The scattered organization of content on both Facebook and Twitter feeds scatters my own brain, and I often find myself making several mental bookmarks as I scroll through, only to forget the thoughts once I finish. I often feel overwhelmed, my mind latching on to something I didn’t care about before and often derailing whatever I planned to do next. With the infinite scrolling, this can literally go on forever.</p>
<p>The good</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Favorite aspects of social media, joyful, meaningful examples of using the internet + facebook,
When I share a life update or accomplishment and receive positive feedback. When I pose a question and receive vulnerable and thoughtful responses. I personally don’t engage much in comment threads. I appreciate seeing regular posts from ~10 close friends (who I’ve marked as as Show First) and less frequent and more major life updates from a wider range of acquaintances.</li>
</ol>
<p>I also find myself checking a variety of different sources for updates on people I care about. For example, several people I want to stay up to date with either aren’t on facebook or don’t post regularly. There are also the collection of people whom I don’t know personally but want to follow to learn and hear ideas from. For these cases, I find myself in a diverse rotation. I’ll go to David Goggin’s instagram profile for a dose of inspiration and motivation to run outside when it’s raining. I’ll check the Twitter accounts of several thinkers and creators to keep a pulse on new ideas. Then I’ll go to the personal websites and blogs of people who don’t post a lot on any traditional platforms to check-in on what they are thinking about. I end up feeling pretty good after this as each update is intentionally sought out, and I am not pulled by the distractions of any timeline or news feed. I choose what I want to see, not the algorithm. People over posts.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>What does a design that maximizes the positive experiences and minimize the least favorite aspects look like?
Based on my own positive and negative experiences with social media, here are 3 design changes I would implement in my ideal social media.</li>
</ol>
<p>Post without seeing feed -
Currently, when you go to the home page of Facebook or Twitter, or Instagram, you are immediately confronted with a piece of content carefully curated to attract your attention.I enjoy sharing on social media, but why should we have to face a test of willpower against distraction each time we do so? Let’s instead make the home page distraction free by default. When you want to share, you can do so without the noise of a newsfeed. Maybe the news feed is a click away, but this design would still encourage intentionality and mindfulness in your decisions.</p>
<p>Center on people, not posts.
While the News Feed style of presenting content can be nice to increase serendipity and get periodic updates on more distant acquaintances, I want my day to day content to focus on people not posts. Instead of a view of posts, let’s have a view of people we want updates on. These people can be grouped into different categories - close friends, influencers, etc. We could show an icon over a person when they have an update. We should probably limit the number of people you follow, but even if you follow many, the scrolling would be through people, not posts, which in principle can’t be infinite.</p>
<p>Daily digest from all sources so don’t have to check each profile manually, can avoid feed
Instead of receiving notifications throughout the day, what if we batched updates in a daily digest that you can read every morning? Similar to reading the morning paper with your cup of coffee, you can get a consolidated view of updates from people you care about. For me, this would replace my regular check of all the profiles I care about across different platforms. I think the growing popularity of the newsletter model (e.g Substack) has highlighted the value of “slower” media and the demand for higher quality, lower bandwidth content networks.</p>
<p>Simplify, slow it down, and focus on the people.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<p>How about content moderation, privacy etc.?
Note that I haven’t mentioned anything about how this ideal social media company would be a sustainable business, nor how it would address the major issues with social media companies today, including content moderation, data privacy, and polarization. My feeling is that these two considerations are highly related. This omission is intentional, as I wanted to focus this thought experiment on the “micro” aspects of social media that personally affect me the most. I will say that while in the short-term products that are bad for humans can make the most money, I believe on a long enough time horizon, tools that align their incentives with human well-being will come out on top.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why having a vision is important?
I don’t think the creators of Facebook had bad intentions. I don’t think we would be better off if social media never existed at all. Rather, I believe it has been a part of a larger technological revolution that has helped connect the world and provide lots of positive value, while at the same time producing serious and harmful side effects that were not foreseen.
But now that we have seen the side effects, it’s our responsibility to address them. In order to do this, I encourage people who want a better experience from social media to imagine the ideal social media for the user you know best - yourself*</p>

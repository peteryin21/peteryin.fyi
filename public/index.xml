      <description>Nobody told me that it&amp;rsquo;s ok to pause
To sit and wait for a worthy cause
That you can be moving through the world or the world can be moving towards you
That if you take the first step then the universe will take 100 steps towards you
That if you write the first sentence, the next sentences will write themselves
This is the art of letting go
Of surrendering to the universal flow</description>

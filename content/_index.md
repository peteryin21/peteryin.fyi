Hi, I'm Peter!

I'm a Biologist turned Software Engineer living in San Francisco.

**Currently**, I work at Zymergen writing softare to control a automated biology lab. Right now, I am taking a few months of part-time to explore and create.

**Previously**, I was at Transcriptic (now Strateos), studied Biology at Penn, and did research in computational genetics and synthetic biology.

**For fun**, I enjoy making videos, swing dancing (back in the day), freestyle rapping, deep conversations, and self-relfection.

**I want to learn more about**: starting a company, making a bootstrapped software product, music production, acting, local politics, science + research, creating a community, stand-up comedy, essay writing.

**Connect** with me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/peteryin21) or <a href="mailto:py.peteryin@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a>. I love a good serendipitous encounter :)

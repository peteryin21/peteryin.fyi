Nobody told me that it's ok to pause

To sit and wait for a worthy cause

That you can be moving through the world or the world can be moving towards you

That if you take the first step then the universe will take 100 steps towards you

That if you write the first sentence, the next sentences will write themselves

This is the art of letting go

Of surrendering to the universal flow

Don't get in the way of yourself

And behold what you are capable of
